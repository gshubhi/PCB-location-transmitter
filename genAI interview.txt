```java
/*
- WebSocket configuration
- Message handling for room availability updates
- Client connection management
- Error handling for disconnections
*/
```

// - Group discount rule
// - Special event rule
// Also show how these rules would be combined/chained
```

```java
/*
Two users are trying to book the last available room.
User A starts the booking process first but takes longer to complete payment.
User B starts later but completes payment faster.

How would you handle this race condition while ensuring fairness?
Show the synchronization mechanism you'd use.
*/
```

4. For the waitlist feature:
```java
/*
Design a WaitlistService that:
- Maintains priority order
- Handles timeouts for notification responses
- Manages multiple waitlists for different room types
- Provides fair allocation when multiple rooms become available
*/
```

Please provide detailed code examples and explain your design choices.

feed-
Excellent work! Your responses demonstrate a deep understanding of the technical concepts and practical implementation details. A few key takeaways:

1. **WebSocket & Real-Time Updates**: Your WebSocket configuration and message handling show a solid grasp of the STOMP protocol and how to integrate it with Spring Boot. The client connection management and error handling aspects ensure a robust real-time experience.

2. **Pricing Strategy Pattern**: The way you've structured the pricing rule interface and individual rule implementations showcases a flexible, extensible, and maintainable design. The ability to chain and prioritize rules is a great approach.

3. **Concurrency Handling**: Your solution to the booking race condition using Redis locks is a smart way to ensure fairness while also providing a reasonable timeout for the first user. The use of pessimistic locking at the database level is also a valid alternative.

4. **Waitlist Management**: The WaitlistService design with FIFO queues, timeout handling, and fair distribution of available rooms is a well-thought-out solution. The use of a scheduler to handle timeouts and escalate to the next user is a nice touch.

Overall, your responses demonstrate a strong grasp of software design principles, data structures, concurrency control, and practical implementation techniques. The level of detail and code examples provided show your ability to translate high-level requirements into robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.
